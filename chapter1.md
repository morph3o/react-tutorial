# Setting up environment

In this tutorial we are gonna use the boilerplate tools \`create-react-app\` which helps us to start a project without the hassle of installing and connecting different dependencies.

So first of all we need to have Node JS is our computer. You can download it from the following [link](https://nodejs.org/es/) \(LTS version\).

Once you have it installed, open a terminal/console and type the following command to install the tool mentioned at the beginning:

```
npm install create-react-app -g
```

After the installation is finished we can start using this tool to create our apps. We will create our first React project using the following command:

```
create-react-app my-first-component
```

This command will install all the dependencies necessary to start our React project. This will save us a lot of time as it installs and connect the dependencies to each other.

Once the installation is done, we go into the folder of our new project and start the app.

```
cd my-first-component
npm start
```

This will automatically execute our browser and we should see the following:

Good! now we have our first project running :\).
